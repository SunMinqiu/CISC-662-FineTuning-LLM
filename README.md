# CISC-662-FineTuning-LLM



# Usage
All the `.ipynb` files are usable, runing them step by step and we get our result. While in some HPC systems like DELTA, extra efforts should be made to make sure the programs run properly, like reinstalling or degrading libraries e.g. Numpy, Torch,...



# About Code:
When I need to change the training arguments or profiles, I just change from the original code. So it means the code I upload is the last version I used rather than all the experiments we did.
I think if we do this experiment again, we will record all changes in different versions. :)
